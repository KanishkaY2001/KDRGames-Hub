CAUTION: Do not do the following unless you have knowledge regarding python (or you are mr smith and want to test our code)

In order to make the Snakes and Ladders, Memory and Battleships python file work, you must place the .py file in this directory:
C:\Users\[INSERT USER HERE]\Desktop\SoftwarePackage
- Or simply place the Python file in the main SoftwarePackage folder, rather than the SourceFiles folder.
	- (Place it in the same place as the SoftwarePackage.exe application)
It will not work otherwise, because of how the directory is set up in the python file.
